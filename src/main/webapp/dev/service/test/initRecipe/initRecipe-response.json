      "ingredients": [
          "1 round loaf artisan bread (16- to 20-ounce loaf)",
          "1 1/2 to 2 cups (6 to 8 ounces) shredded cheese",
          "Optional mix-ins: cooked bacon or sausage, minced chives or sliced green onions, red pepper flakes, chili powder",
          "1/4 cup unsalted butter"
      ],
      "equipment": [
          "Bread knife",
          "Cutting board",
          "Mixing bowls",
          "Aluminum foil"
      ],
      "instructions": [
          "<strong>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</strong>",
          "<strong>Slice the bread into cubes:</strong> Slice the bread horizontally and vertically into 1-inch cubes. Do not slice all the way through the loaf — leave bottom of the loaf intact with the bread pieces still attached.",
          "<strong>Combine the cheese with any mix-ins:</strong> Toss the cheese and mix-ins together in a small bowl. This helps make sure the ingredients are evenly distributed when you stuff the bread.",
          "<strong>Stuff the cheese into the bread:</strong> Gently stuff the cheese into the bread between the slices. Stuff between the vertical slices first, then go back and fill in the spaces between the horizontal cuts — it's a bit easier this way! It also helps to have a helper who can hold the slices apart while you stuff.",
          "<strong>Pour melted butter over top:</strong> Transfer the stuffed loaf to a sheet of foil. Melt the butter in the microwave, then pour evenly over the loaf.",
          "<strong>Wrap the loaf tightly in foil.</strong>",
          "<strong>Bake the loaf:</strong> Bake the loaf for 20 minutes. Uncover the top and bake for another 10 minutes, until the cheese is totally melted and the top of the loaf is crispy.",
          "<strong>Serve immediately:</strong> Serve the loaf while still hot from the oven."
